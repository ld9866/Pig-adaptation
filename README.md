# Pig-adaptation
Pigs, as the earliest domesticated and widely distributed domestic animal, have gradually adapted to the diversified climate and ecological environment on the earth for a long time with the footprints of humans. However, there is still little research on the adaptation of pigs to different environments which limited our knowledge of pig adapt to different environment. In order to bridge this gap, we collected 151 different population (1162 pig genome accessions) from all over the world and coupled three different algorithms (Redundancy Analysis (RDA), Baypass and latent factor mixed models (LFMM)) to identify the sources of adaptative across naturally heterogeneous ecosystems.
